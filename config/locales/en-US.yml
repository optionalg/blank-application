    sub_title: how to localize your app with Rails' new i18n features
    about: 
      author: This demo app was written by {{mail_1}}.
      title: About this demo app
      feedback: If you have any feedback, please feel free to drop me a line. Also visit {{blog_href}} where I regularly blog about Rails and other stuff.
      licence: This demo app and all its contents are licensed under the {{licence_href}}. If you want to use it in ways prohibited by this license, please contact me and ask my permission.
    number_helper: 
      note_two: "Another note: number_to_currency, number_to_percentage and number_to_human_size all use number_with_precision internally and number_with_precision uses number_with_delimiter internally."
      note_one: "Note: number_to_phone hasn't been localized yet and probably never will be - at least not in core. Look out for new internationalization/localization plugins like a new version of {{globalize}} as they will probably support stuff like that."
    index: 
      others: others
      introduction: Lately, a lot of work has been done by {{sven_blog}} and {{sven_github}} to facilitate future internationalization and localization of Rails.
      story_so_far: This demo app tries to show you how you can use the features that have been implemented so far to localize big parts of your Rails application.
    setup: 
      config_locale: Configuring the locale
      best_place: The best place to put your locale configuration, in my opinion, is config/locales. The localized_dates plugin will copy two locales, en-US and de-AT, in this directory. You can extend or modify them and also create new locales.
      freezing_edge_and_adding: Freezing Edge and installing the localized_dates plugin
      you_need_to_be_on_edge: "You need to be on Edge Rails in order to use the Rails i18n features:"
      locale_structure_date_time: "The same holds true for dates and times: If needed, :datetime and :time_with_zone can be used to specifically address formatting of their respective types instead of just relying on the settings for :time. Note, however, that usually you want to use the same formats as :time."
      defaults: You also need to set up the default locale and/or locale in your environment.rb or an initializer.
      locale: "Here's the demo locale that was used for this demo application:"
      locale_structure_number: You may have noticed that inside the :number part of the locale, we defined :format and :currency. In general, locales are structured hierarchically - i.e. a currencies are numbers, percentages are numbers, etc. :currency can either override the basic :format settings (in our case, we set :precision to 2 instead of 3) or extend them (we add two new options, :unit and :format).
      date_time_formats: "For date and time formats, you also need to install the {{localized_dates_link}}:"
