    setup: 
      best_place: The best place to put your locale configuration, in my opinion, is config/locales. The localized_dates plugin will copy two locales, en-US and de-AT, in this directory. You can extend or modify them and also create new locales.

      freezing_edge_and_adding: Freezing Edge and installing the localized_dates plugin
      locale_structure_date_time: "The same holds true for dates and times: If needed, :datetime and :time_with_zone can be used to specifically address formatting of their respective types instead of just relying on the settings for :time. Note, however, that usually you want to use the same formats as :time."
      you_need_to_be_on_edge: "You need to be on Edge Rails in order to use the Rails i18n features:"
      locale_structure_title: A word on the structure of locales
      defaults: You also need to set up the default locale and/or locale in your environment.rb or an initializer.
      locale_structure_number: You may have noticed that inside the :number part of the locale, we defined :format and :currency. In general, locales are structured hierarchically - i.e. a currencies are numbers, percentages are numbers, etc. :currency can either override the basic :format settings (in our case, we set :precision to 2 instead of 3) or extend them (we add two new options, :unit and :format).
