      <h1>make_resourceful</h1>
<h5>Take back control of your Controllers. Make them awesome. Make them sleek. Make them resourceful.</h5>
<p>
REST is a fine pattern for designing controllers, but it can be pretty
repetitive. Who wants to write out the same actions and copy the same model
lookup logic all over their application?
</p>
<p>
make_resourceful handles all that for you. It sets up all your RESTful
actions and responses with next to no code. Everything has full, sensible
default functionality.
</p>
<p>
Of course, no controller <em>only</em> uses the defaults. So
make_resourceful can be massively customized, while still keeping your
controllers trim and readable.
</p>
<h2>Get it!</h2>
<p>
Rails
</p>
<pre>
  $ ruby script/plugin install http://svn.hamptoncatlin.com/make_resourceful/trunk
  $ mv vendor/plugins/trunk vendor/plugins/make_resourceful
</pre>
<p>
Subversion
</p>
<pre>
  $ svn co http://svn.hamptoncatlin.com/make_resourceful/trunk make_resourceful
</pre>
<h2>Use it!</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to start with make_resourceful is to run the
resource_scaffold generator. It uses the same syntax as the Rails
scaffold_resource generator:
</p>
<pre>
  $ script/generate resource_scaffold post title:string body:text
</pre>
<p>
It does, however, require <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com">Haml</a>.
You <em>are</em> using Haml, right? No? I&#8216;ll wait here while you go
fall in love with it.
</p>
<p>
If you want to try make_resourceful on one of your current controllers,
just replace the mess of repetition with this:
</p>
<pre>
  class FooController &lt; ApplicationController
    make_resourceful do
      actions :all
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
Those three lines will replace the entire default controller that comes out
of the scaffold_resource generator.
</p>
<h3>Really?</h3>
<p>
Yes.
</p>
<h3>Can I do nested resources?</h3>
<pre>
  make_resourceful do
    actions :all
    belongs_to :post
  end
</pre>
<h3>What if I want to use fancy permalinks?</h3>
<pre>
  def current_object
    @current_object ||= current_model.find_by_permalink(params[:id])
  end
</pre>
<h3>What about paging?</h3>
<pre>
  def current_objects
    @current_object ||= current_model.find(:all,
      :order =&gt; &quot;created_at DESC&quot;, :page =&gt; {:current =&gt; params[:page], :size =&gt; 10 } )
  end
</pre>
<h3>What if I want to do something in the middle of an action?</h3>
<pre>
  before :show, :index do
    @page_title = &quot;Awesome!&quot;
  end

  after :create_fails do
    @page_title = &quot;Not So Awesome!&quot;
  end
</pre>
<h3>What about all of my awesome respond_to blocks for my XML APIs and RJS responses?</h3>
<pre>
  response_for :show do |format|
    format.html
    format.js
    format.xml
  end

  response_for :update_fails do |format|
    format.html { render :action =&gt; 'edit' }
    format.json { render :json =&gt; false.to_json, :status =&gt; 422 }
  end
</pre>
<h3>So I guess I have to write responses for all my actions?</h3>
<p>
Nope! make_resourceful makes them do the right thing by default. You only
need to customize them if you want to do something special.
</p>
<h3>Seriously?!</h3>
<p>
Yes!
</p>
<h2>Grok it!</h2>
<h3><tt>make_resourceful</tt> the Method</h3>
<p>
The <tt>make_resourceful</tt> block is where most of the action happens.
Here you specify which actions you want to auto-generate, what code you
want to run for given callbacks, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
You also use the block to declare various bits of information about your
controller. For instance, if the controller is nested, you&#8216;d call
<tt>belongs_to</tt>. If you wanted to expose your models as some sort of
text format, you&#8216;d call <tt>publish</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Check out the documentation of <a
href="../../../../classes/Resourceful/Builder.html">Resourceful::Builder</a>
for more information on the methods you can call here.
</p>
<h3>Helper Methods</h3>
<p>
make_resourceful provides lots of useful methods that can be used in your
callbacks and in your views. They range from accessing the records
you&#8216;re looking up to easily generating URLs for a record to getting
information about the action itself.
</p>
<p>
Two of the most useful methods are <tt>current_object</tt> and
<tt>current_objects</tt> (note the subtle plurality difference).
<tt>current_objects</tt> only works for <tt>index</tt>, and returns all the
records in the current model. <tt>current_object</tt> works for all actions
other than <tt>index</tt>, and returns the record that&#8216;s currently
being dealt with.
</p>
<p>
The full documentation of the helper methods is in <a
href="../../../../classes/Resourceful/Default/Accessors.html">Resourceful::Default::Accessors</a>
and <a
href="../../../../classes/Resourceful/Default/URLs.html">Resourceful::Default::URLs</a>.
</p>
<h3>Nested Resources</h3>
<p>
make_resourceful supports easy management of nested resources. This is set
up with the Resourceful::Builder#belongs_to declaration. Pass in the name
of the parent model,
</p>
<pre>
  belongs_to :user
</pre>
<p>
and everything will be taken care of. When <tt>index</tt> is run for GET
/users/12/albums, <a
href="../../../../classes/Resourceful/Accessors.html#M000024">parent_object</a>
will get <tt>User.find(params[:user_id])</tt>, and <a
href="../../../../classes/Resourceful/Default/Accessors.html#M000010">current_objects</a>
will get <tt>parent_object.albums</tt>. When <tt>create</tt> is run for
POST /users/12/albums, the newly created Album will automatically belong to
the user with id 12.
</p>
<p>
The normal non-scoped actions still work, too. GET /albums/15 runs just
fine. make_resourceful knows that since there&#8216;s no
<tt>params[:user_id]</tt>, you just want to deal with the album.
</p>
<p>
You can even have a single resource nested under several different
resources. Just pass multiple parent names to the
Resourceful::Builder#belongs_to, like
</p>
<pre>
  belongs_to :user, :artist
</pre>
<p>
Then /users/15/albums and /artists/7/albums will both work.
</p>
<p>
This does, however, mean that make_resourceful only supports one level of
nesting. There&#8216;s no automatic handling of
/users/15/collections/437/albums. However, this is really the best way to
organize most resources anyway; see this <a
href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/2/5/nesting-resources">article</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you really need a deeply nested controller, it should be easy enough to
set up on your own. Just override <a
href="../../../../classes/Resourceful/Default/Accessors.html#M000018">current_model</a>.
See the next section for more details.
</p>
<h3>Overriding Methods</h3>
<p>
Not only are helper methods useful to the developer to use, they&#8216;re
used internally by the actions created by make_resourceful. Thus one of the
main ways make_resourceful can be customized is by overriding accessors.
</p>
<p>
For instance, if you want to only look up the 10 most recent records for
<tt>index</tt>, you&#8216;re override <tt>current_objects</tt>. If you
wanted to use a different model than that suggested by the name of the
controller, you&#8216;d override <tt>current_model</tt>.
</p>
<p>
When you&#8216;re overriding methods that do SQL lookups, though, be a
little cautious. By default, these methods cache their values in instance
variables so that multiple SQL queries aren&#8216;t run on multiple calls.
When overriding them, it&#8216;s wise for you to do the same. For instance,
</p>
<pre>
  def current_object
    @current_object ||= current_model.find_by_name(params[:name])
  end
</pre>
<h3>For More Information&#8230;</h3>
<p>
Haven&#8216;t found all the information you need in the RDoc? Still a
little confused about something? Don&#8216;t despair, there are still more
resources available!
